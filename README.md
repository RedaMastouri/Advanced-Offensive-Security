This course is designed for students to be trained in Advanced Offensive Security tactics and techniques. This includes the full hacking lifecycle from enumeration/vulnerability discovery, to exploitation, followed by post exploitation activities. Students will learn how to strategically enumerate network devices and exploit various resources, fuzz applications and network protocols to identify bugs/vulnerabilities, execute advanced Man-in-the-Middle attacks, along with conducting post exploitation activities on both Linux and Windows machines. Additionally, students will be introduced to Python ‚Äì including Python fundamentals and development of custom tools/exploits, along with PowerShell usage from a penetration testers perspective. Lastly, students will be introduced to Splunk to provide a better understanding of the network traffic generated as result of our activities, along with how security teams can identify/alert/investigate all resulting traffic.
